# Simple p5.js starter template

Replce the sketch.js with your own code and you are ready to go!

If you are using vs code I recommend you use the [Live Server]() extension to start the server.

It has auto-reload and all the other cool stuff.

Serve is also a good option if not using VS Code.

Install it using `npm install -g serve`

and just type `serve` in the terminal to start the server in the current directory.
